# Slack Clone #

## Motivation ##

Welcome to my slack clone [here](https://slack-clone-exhlim.web.app/). I built this application to have a better understanding of the implementation of chatting functionalities as well as an opportunity to use React context API and learn a different way of using google authentication sign in compared to my previous "Gmail Clone with keyword sorting feature" project. (Preview below)

## Functionalities: ##
